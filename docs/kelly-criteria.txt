-Question: if my model predicts a win of 5.5% on 95% of the cases and lost of 10% in the 5% what should be the optimal bet size. Think carefully and step by step

MIO: Are calculations wrong?? where do you get the 30% ? if I calculate f= (0.047 - 1) / (0.0090) get -105.888888889

To determine the optimal bet size for a model that predicts a win of 5.5% on 95% of the cases and a loss of 10% in the remaining 5%, you can use a technique called **Kelly Criterion**. This method aims to maximize the expected growth rate of your bankroll over time.

**Step 1: Calculate Expected Value**

The expected value (EV) of a bet is the average of the possible outcomes, weighted by their probability. In this case, the expected value for a win is 5.5% of the bet size, and the expected value for a loss is -10% of the bet size.

Since the model predicts a win in 95% of cases, the expected value can be calculated as:

```
EV = (0.95 * 0.055) - (0.05 * (-0.1)) = 0.047
```

**Step 2: Calculate Kelly Criterion Fraction**

The Kelly Criterion fraction (f) is a formula that determines the optimal bet size based on the expected value and the risk aversion of the bettor. The formula is:

```
f = (EV - 1) / (Variance)
```

The variance is a measure of the uncertainty or variability in the possible outcomes. In this case, the variance can be approximated as:

```
Variance = (-0.1)^2 / (0.95) = 0.0090
```

Substituting the expected value and variance into the Kelly Criterion fraction formula, we get:

```
f = (0.047 - 1) / (0.0090) = 0.30
```

This means that the optimal bet size is 30% of the available bankroll.

**Step 3: Adjust for Risk Aversion**

The Kelly Criterion fraction assumes that the bettor is risk-neutral, meaning they are indifferent between equal gains and losses. However, most bettors are risk-averse, meaning they prefer smaller, more consistent gains over larger, riskier gains.

To adjust for risk aversion, you can use a risk aversion factor (λ) that reflects your willingness to take on risk. A higher λ value indicates a higher degree of risk aversion. A commonly used value for λ is 2.

The adjusted Kelly Criterion fraction (f') is calculated as:

```
f' = f / (1 + λ^2 * f^2)
```

Substituting the values for f and λ, we get:

```
f' = 0.30 / (1 + 4 * (0.30)^2) = 0.26
```

This means that the optimal bet size for a risk-averse bettor is 26% of the available bankroll.

Therefore, the optimal bet size for this model is between 26% and 30% of the available bankroll, depending on the bettor's risk tolerance. A risk-averse bettor would choose the lower bet size to minimize the potential for large losses, while a risk-seeking bettor would choose the higher bet size to maximize the potential for large gains.
